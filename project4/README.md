A tool for algorithmic composition. Specifically, it can generates a semi-random
drum track and (hopefully) a bassline and chord progression to go with it.

Usage
-----

1. Stick it in a DAW
2. Route the MIDI out to your instrument of choice
3. Select the type of track you want generated in the GUI
